This mod turns the title screen into a music player that plays music indefinitely! Customize using settings.json. To turn this off, go to [Options] --> [Mods] --> uncheck [music-player].

[Instructions]
1. Get CCLoader if you haven't already.
2. Place this folder in "assets/mods/" so that it looks like "assets/mods/music-player/plugin.js".
3. Open "settings.json" and set "song" to the value you see in the track list. For example, if you wanted to listen to the M.S. Solar theme, you'd set "song" to "cargoship-exterior".
4. If you want to change the song that's playing, enter "setSong('cargoship-exterior')" in the console for example. If you want to pause/resume the music, enter "setSong()". And you can also play a random song by entering "playRandom()". If you want to specify the selection of songs to choose from, enter "playRandom(['title','oldHideout1','oldHideoutBattle','oldHideoutEnding'])" for example.

[WARNING]
The names of songs are spoilerific, so if you haven't completed the game yet, you have been warned.
