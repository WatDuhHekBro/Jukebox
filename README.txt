This mod turns the title screen into a music player that plays music indefinitely! Customize using settings.json. To turn this off, go to [Options] --> [Mods] --> uncheck [music-player].

[Instructions]
1. Get CCLoader if you haven't already.
2. Place this folder in "assets/mods/" so that it looks like "assets/mods/music-player/plugin.js".
3. Open "settings.json" and set "song" to the value you see in the track list. For example, if you wanted to listen to the M.S. Solar theme, you'd set "song" to "cargoship-exterior".

[WARNING]
The names of songs are spoilerific, so if you haven't completed the game yet, you have been warned.
